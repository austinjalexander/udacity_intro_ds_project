The Mann-Whitney $U$ test indicated that rainy and non-rainy days were essentially identical. Thus, there did not appear to be either a statistical or, based on the effect size values, practical difference between rainy days and non-rainy days in terms of their respective number of entries."

Thus, the data set was limited by its temporal locale.\n",

However, it's unclear how traditional statistical tests relate to massive data sets (esp. since many statitical tests need to be used with relatively small sample sizes; on this point, see 5.2 below).\n",
