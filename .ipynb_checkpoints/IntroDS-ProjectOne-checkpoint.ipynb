    "The Mann-Whitney $U$ test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the number of reported entries on rainy and non-rainy occasions. This nonparametric test of the equality of two population medians from independent samples was used since the distribution of entries is non-normal (right-skewed) and their shape is the same, as seen visually via histograms, probability plots, and box plots, and as the result of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (see <a href='IntroDS-ProjectOne-DataExploration-Supplement.ipynb#prep-for-stats' target='_blank'>Preparation for Statistical Tests</a>). However, since the sample sizes are so large, the parametric Welch's $t$-test likely could have been used (and, it was implemented for confirmation purposes, along with the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test; both agreed with the Mann-Whitney $U$ test results)."

As a result, among countless other possible factors for which the available data did not account, precipitation may in fact have an increased impact on the number of entries at other times of the year (e.g., during the winter months). Thus, the data set was limited by its temporal locale.\n",
